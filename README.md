# Python-RiotAPI-Wrapper v0.5.1
This is an innofical wrapper for the riotapi, means that an understanding of the original API is needed. note that this project does not currently have any documentation and will probably get one once it reaches version 1.0.0 (current version)

Changelog
added class related stuff. now needs an active instance of that class in your file.
added support for the match-v5 API
